My KWoC Experience :
In just a short period of time, I get acquainted with git ,GitHub. I also learnt many git commands here. I can now easily read and understand commits on GitHub which was hard to read then. I am very thankful to my mentor and other contributor who helped me during my journey of learning . I heard of Github but never contributed to any project before, it is tremendous feeling to contribute and to see your changes on the app which inspire us to make more commits . I would like express my gratitude to KWoC for this beginner programme which gives kickoff to the beginners towards OpenSource contribution.
